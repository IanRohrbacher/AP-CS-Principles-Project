# AP CS Principles Project
Submitted for the 2021 AP CS Principles coding portion of the AP test.


## Project Overview
This is a full recreation of [Yahtzee](https://grail.sourceforge.net/demo/yahtzee/rules.html) using Python and Pygame. The project demonstrates use of file storage with `pickle` to save and display the highest score.

There are two versions included:
- **rng/**: Standard Yahtzee with random dice rolls. Tracks and saves your best score.
- **rigged/**: Scripted version where dice outcomes are mostly static. Used to demo all features for grading.


## Getting Started
### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) (install with `pip install pygame`)

### Running the Game
1. Choose either the `rng` or `rigged` folder.
2. Open a terminal in that folder.
3. Run:
	```
	python main.py
	```

## Features
- One-to-one recreation of Yahtzee gameplay
- Score breakdown display
- High score saving (in `rng` version)
- Simple graphics using Pygame


## Notes
- The `rigged` version is for demonstration/testing only.
- The `rng` version is the standard game.
