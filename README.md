# AP CS Principles Project
This project was submited for the 2021 AP CS Principles AP coding portion of the test.


## What is the Project?
The project is a recreation of Yahtzee using Pygame. I also utilized 'pickle' which will store and display the highest score. There are two folders with the same structure. One, rng, is a purely random game of Yahtzee. The other, rigged, is a scripted game where the outcome of the dice, for the most part, are static. The rigged game was used to demonstrate every feature programmed.


## Getting started
### Installing
- You will need Pygame which you can install using [this](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted). <br>
- Installing Pygame uses pip which can be followed in the Pygame instructions or [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

### Running
Download either the 'rng' or 'rigged' folder and open it in your desired python environment and run it.


## Features
The program is, from my understanding, a one to one recreation of [Yahtzee](https://grail.sourceforge.net/demo/yahtzee/rules.html). It also displays a breakdown of your score and saves the highest score when playing the rng game. 


## Licensing
The code in this project is licensed under MIT license.
